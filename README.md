# Xpress UI
![Xpress UI 预览](/Readme-images/image-1.png)

## Overview
Xpress UI components use the shadcn/ui CSS variables and are designed to work neatly with the existing primitives.

Much like the core shadcn/ui primitives, the Xpress UI components are effectively a collection of building blocks that can be used to create more complex components. They encompass a wide range of use-cases and are designed to reduce boilerplate code without sacrificing flexibility and responsive design.

While shadcn/ui focuses on wrapping primitives from Radix UI, Xpress UI is designed to be a more comprehensive library of components that can be used to build more complex applications. The components wrap more complex logic from various headless libraries to provide a more seamless experience.
