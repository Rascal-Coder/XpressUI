## Prerequisites

Before installing Xpress-UI, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 18 or later
- A [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) project, version 18 or later
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) installed in your project


<Callout type="warning">
Note: If you havenâ€™t installed shadcn/ui yet, you should do that first. Follow the official shadcn/ui setup instructions to configure Tailwind CSS and the base components. Kibo UI builds on that foundation, so having shadcn in place is required.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Xpress-UI currently only supports the CSS Variables version of shadcn/ui
</Callout>

## Installation

You can install Xpress-UI components using either the `xpress-ui` or `shadcn` CLI e.g.
<Installer packageName="{package}" />



This will install the component into your project at `@/components/xpress-ui/{package}` (or the relevant folder you specified in the `components.json` file).

## Usage

After installing a Xpress-UI component, you can start using it in your React application.

For example, check out the [Gantt Chart](/gantt) component.
